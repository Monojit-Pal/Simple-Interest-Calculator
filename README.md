# Simple-Interest-Calculator
This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple web page that calculates the simple interest based on the userâ€™s input for principal, rate of interest, and time. The project demonstrates basic web development concepts such as form handling, input validation, and dynamic DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
